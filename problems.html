    <h1>What is harming the coral reefs?</h1>

    <p>Now coral reefs are imperiled by several threats.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 1000">1.</span> The increasing acidification of the ocean — caused when oceans absorb immense amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels — inhibits coral's ability to produce the calcium carbonate exoskeletons they rely on for shelter.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 1000">2.</span> Water pollution, too, is wreaking havoc on coral reefs. Agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, oil and gasoline, sewage discharge and sediment from eroded landscapes make it difficult for coral to thrive, and therefore damage the complex relationships that exist among the plants, coral and other animals that are part of the reef ecosystem.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 1000">3.</span> As the temperatures of the world's oceans increase due to global warming, coral polyps expel the zooxanthellae they depend on for food. Once the zooxanthellae are gone, the coral loses its brilliant color, and all that can be seen is the white exoskeleton; this is referred to as coral bleaching. Coral colonies subject to bleaching usually die off.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 1000">4.</span> Fishing practices such as cyanide fishing (spraying cyanide in the water stuns the fish to make them easier to catch), "blast fishing" with explosives and overfishing with trawlers can destroy a thousand-year-old coral reef in a matter of minutes."Overfishing, ocean acidification and pollution are pushing coral reefs into oblivion," Roger Bradbury, an ecologist at the Australian National University in Canberra, wrote in his New York Times opinion article. "Each of those forces alone is fully capable of causing the global collapse of coral reefs; together, they assure it."</p>
